# Research Group: Quantitative Imaging and Medical Physics (QIMP) Team
# Date: 07.07.2023
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# Module: input_validation
#
# Description:
# The `input_validation` module stands guard at the gates of PUMA-Z, ensuring that only valid, compliant data enters its realm. 
# As the name suggests, it is tasked with a critical functionâ€”ensuring that every piece of input data adheres to PUMA-Z's stringent 
# requirements. In the intricate maze of medical imaging data, consistency, accuracy, and standardization are paramount.
#
# Leveraging meticulous algorithms and smart logic, this module sifts through the input data, differentiating between compliant and 
# non-compliant data. Whether it's checking naming conventions or ensuring that data modalities match expected standards, the 
# `input_validation` module doesn't miss a beat.
#
# Usage:
# The primary purpose of this module is to serve as a sentinel, invoked by other PUMA-Z modules whenever data is ingested. By 
# incorporating this module's functions, developers can be assured that PUMA-Z's internal operations always work on pristine, 
# compliant data, setting the stage for high-quality outputs.
