# Description:
# This module performs input validation for the pumaz. It verifies that the inputs provided by the user are valid
# and meets the required specifications.
#
# Usage:
# The functions in this module can be imported and used in other modules within the moosez to perform input validation.

    from the `rich.progress` module. The function returns a dictionary containing the identified modalities.

    Parameters:
    directory (str): The directory to identify the modalities from.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the identified modalities. The keys are the modality tags and the values are
    the topmost directory paths for each modality.

    Example:
    >>> directory = "/path/to/directory"
